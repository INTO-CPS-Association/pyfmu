PyFMU provides functionality that support various phases of creating an FMU, such as creating a template project for a new FMU, verifying its functionality and configuring its execution during co-simulation.
The functionality can be accessed using a command line tool called `pyfmu`:

.. command-output:: pyfmu --help


Like Git, the distinct functionalities of the tool are grouped as subcommands.
Similarly, usage information on specific subcommand can be accessed using the help flag.
