- Cleaning up PyFMU for Hubcap presentation later this month.
- Moving logic from wrapper into Python
  - Easier to extend and maintain
  - No memory leaks
- Cross platform C/C++ + Third party libraries are a pain in the butt

  - Exteremely brittle on Windows.

- Experimenting with Rust language
  - has bindings for python.
  - built in package manager and cross platform build.
  - definitly a more pleasant development experience.
